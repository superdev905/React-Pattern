# In brief

This cookbook is targeting developers that already have basic understanding of what React is and how it works. It's not meant to be used as a complete how-to guide but as an introduction to popular concepts/design patterns. Paradigms that more or less are introduced by the community. It points you to an abstract thinking. For example, instead of talking about Flux, it talks about data flow. Instead of talking about higher-order components it talks about composition.

The book is highly opinioned. It represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible tha they have a different interpretation around the web. Have this in mind when arguing with someone and using this book as an argument.
