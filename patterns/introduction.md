## [React in patterns](../../README.md) / Introduction

This book is targeting developers that already have basic understanding of what React is and how it works. It's not meant to be used as a complete how-to guide but as an introduction to popular concepts/design patterns. Paradigms which more or less are introduced by the community. It points you to an abstract thinking. For example, instead of talking about Flux it talks about data flow. Instead of talking about higher-order component it talks about composition. There are implementation details but they are here to show how to solve a bigger problem.

The book is highly opinioned. It represents my own understanding of the described patterns and it is possible tha they have a different interpretation around the web.
