## [React in patterns](../../README.md) / Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a library that acts as a state container and helps managing your application data flow. It was introduced back in 2015 at ReactEurope conference ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)) by [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov). It is inspired by the [Flux architecture](https://github.com/krasimir/react-in-patterns/tree/master/patterns/flux) and has a lot in common with it. In this section we will create a small counter app using Redux alongside React.
